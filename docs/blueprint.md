## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated azure blue (#4682B4), evocative of ocean luxury. Selected to communicate the spirit of Dubaiâ€™s waterfront lifestyle. Azure provides enough color that it does not feel as austere as neutral palettes.
- Background color: Very light blue-gray (#E5E9EC), providing a sophisticated, calm backdrop that emulates a cloudy sky near the sea.
- Accent color: Vibrant yellow-orange (#FFB347) used for buttons and key highlights. Choosen because yellow-orange creates the right amount of differentiation from the blues to call attention.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern aesthetic across all text elements.
- Use clean, minimalist icons representing yachts and water activities for easy navigation.
- Employ a grid-based layout for structured and responsive content presentation.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations for enhanced user engagement.
